This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) aimed at accompaning the [blockhain backend](https://github.com/soulaymaneabiadou/blockchain-nodejs) repo, and provide a visual way to check the blockhain and interact with it.
Please note that this is not meant to be used for a production deployment of the blockhain(although you can choose to).
